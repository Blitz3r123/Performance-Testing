Today we talked a lot around the tests that I had run for the updated scripts. Here is the script for one publisher and one subscriber:

Publisher:
perftest_java.bat -pub -dataLen 4096 -numSubscribers 1 -domain 1 -executionTime 10

Subscriber:
perftest_java.bat -sub -dataLen 4096 -domain 1 -sidMultiSubTest 0

We agreed that I will do the following tasks:

1. Run minimum latency test to create baseline for latency results in the future
2. Run multiple tests with varying samples. Here are the layouts of the test that I will run:
	1 Publisher 1 Subscriber 10, 100, 1000 Samples

	1 Publisher 2 Subscriber 10, 100, 1000 Samples

	1 Publisher 5 Subscriber 10, 100, 1000 Samples

	1 Publisher 10 Subscriber 10, 100, 1000 Samples
3. Find out if each line written to the csv file is a second.
4. Find out what each column represents for the publisher and subscriber.
5. Find it variable counters are reset only once or every second.

We also talked about Benchmark Uniformity where we want RTI tests and OpenSplice tests to be as similar as possible. I will also be taking the next two weeks off to revise for my exams and we plan to maybe meet Wed 22nd in the afternoon or Tue 28th on Skype.
