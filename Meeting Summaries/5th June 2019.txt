Today we analysed my latency test results and here is what we saw:

- Test was run for 10 seconds but there were only 9 rows.
- There are unknown reasons for values for the average, standard deviation and maximum on the first result.

Here are the next steps:

1. Run following tests for 10, 120 and 300 seconds:
	a. Repeat latency test with no multicast and no change in samples.
	b. Run latency test with latencyCount of 1.
2. Run throughput tests for 10, 120 and 300 seconds for the following:
	a. 1 Publisher 1 Subscriber
		i. latencyCount of 10 samples
		ii. latencyCount of 100 samples
		iii. latencyCount of 1000 samples

For all tests machine will be restarted after a test has been run.

Once results have been attained for step 1, I will contact you and hopefully we can arrange a meeting to discuss the results.
