 Hope you are doing well. Good news! I have managed to get the buffer implemented on both the publisher and the subscriber sides. I have also muted all outputs to the terminal. Attached is a copy of the source files. Nayim please let me know  if the tests run fine.

Here is a brief overview of what I did to implement the buffer.

    Created 4 array lists with appropriate names and data types found on lines 121 to 124 in PerfTest.java
    Used variable values to add to the arary lists on lines 917 to 920 in PerfTest.java
    After the subscriber method is called (meaning the test is over), used a for loop to iterate over all array lists and write them to the csv file on lines 233 to 239 in PerfTest.java


Thankfully the solution was a lot simpler than expected although there was a lot of code analysis. Vlad, I will now debug the windows virtual machines the way you mentioned yesterday. Here is a brief summary:

    Run 1 pub 1 sub on a single machine on various machines.
    Run 1 pub on one machine 1 sub on another and try different pairs/combinations.
    Run 1 pub 1 sub on one machine with domain 1 and 1 pub 1 sub on another machine with domain 2.
    I will also use debugging tools/techniques to understand which code is being executed and when and identify a solution.

All the best,
Kaleem
