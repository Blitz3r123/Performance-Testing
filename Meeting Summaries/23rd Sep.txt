We analysed Nayim and I's results. From the results Peter determined that best effort multicast would be the best way to attack a distributed system. We decided to do the following in the future:

Nayim will run test with 1, 10, 100 instances. 100 instances will be determined depending on whether machines can handle for example 20 or 50.

Kaleem will finish running tests for 512 byte and 4k before running multi instance tests like Nayim.
